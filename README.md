# Elm list filtering experiment (using a default state)

The form displays a result based on a default filter to illustrate to the end-user how the filter works.

View uses [stylish-elephants](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/stylish-elephants/4.0.0), the experimental style-elements package.
